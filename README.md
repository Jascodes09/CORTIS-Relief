# 🌍 AI-Powered Disaster Response and Relief Coordination Platform

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **comprehensive AI-powered disaster management platform** designed to coordinate relief efforts, predict disaster impact, and optimize resource allocation during natural disasters and emergencies in India.  

The system integrates **AI models, real-time updates, and multilingual communication tools** to ensure rapid and accurate disaster response, even in low-connectivity environments.

## 🚨 Key Features
- **Disaster Prediction** – AI models (TensorFlow) analyze weather & geographic data to predict disaster zones.  
- **Real-Time Damage Assessment** – Immediate insights for ongoing disasters.  
- **Survivor Location Tracking** – Helps locate and reunite missing people.  
- **Resource & Inventory Management** – Track relief supplies and optimize distribution.  
- **Volunteer & NGO Coordination** – Connects government agencies, NGOs, and volunteers.  
- **Emergency Communication** – Multilingual alerts distributed in under 30 seconds.  
- **Offline Support** – Critical features accessible in low/no connectivity areas.  
- **Mobile Application** – React Native app for field responders.
